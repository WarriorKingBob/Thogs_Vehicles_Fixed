# Thogs-Vehicles
Mod for CDDA-BN, adding a huge variety of aircraft, watercraft, and ground-based vehicles of both the military and civilian variety, ranging from compact urban cars to gyrocopters, experimental military aircraft, and a litany of new solar and alternatively powered options. Modified from Thog's vehicles to be standalone. This version removes all the new gear from Thogs Things and only keeps new vehicle parts. Micromissile launchers are replaced with M134D-H Miniguns. New professions are kept for those that like to roleplay.

The image with military choppers are not up to date. Will be updated later.
