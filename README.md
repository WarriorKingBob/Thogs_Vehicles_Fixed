# Thogs_Vehicles_Standalone
Mod for CDDA-BN, adding a huge variety of aircraft, watercraft, and ground-based vehicles of both the military and civilian variety, ranging from compact urban cars to gyrocopters, experimental military aircraft, and a litany of new solar and alternatively powered options. Modified from Thog's vehicles to be standalone. This version removes all the new gear from Thogs Things and only keeps new vehicle parts. Micromissile launchers and its survivor variant are kept because the helicopters are badass. New professions are kept for those that like to roleplay.
