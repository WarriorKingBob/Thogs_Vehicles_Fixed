# !Warning!
Delete the entire portion for "drugdealer" from gear_itemgroups.json in ThogsThings if you are using Bright nights versions newer than 10/30 Nightly build. As outlined here: https://github.com/cataclysmbnteam/Cataclysm-BN/pull/5635, The updates changes "drugdealer" from itemgroup to collection. Loading the mod without removing the code WILL crash your game! We can only wait for the original author Thog to fix this, as I don't know how to.

# Thogs_Vehicles_Fixed
Mod for CDDA-BN, adding a huge variety of aircraft, watercraft, and ground-based vehicles of both the military and civilian variety, ranging from compact urban cars to gyrocopters, experimental military aircraft, and a litany of new solar and alternatively powered options. This version mostly fixes bugs from caninmyham's original mod.

Changes and fixes from caninmyham's original mod:
- Adds Thog's Things as dependancy.
- Rocket handcannon recipe fixed, now requires the Rocket Rifle as a component instead of nothing
- Mounted Calico M960 on Spy car changed to M249. An SMG is too weak as a front mounted hidden gun, plus this eliminates conflict with Blazemod. Calico M960 instead have a high chance of spawning in the passenger's seat.
